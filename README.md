# Stealth DBMS - A Basic Database Management System

_A comprehensive SQL-like Database Management System developed as a third semester Data Structures and Algorithms project_

## Project Description

Stealth DBMS is a lightweight, custom-built database management system implemented in C++ that demonstrates the practical application of advanced data structures and algorithms in database design. This project showcases a complete DBMS implementation with SQL-like query processing, efficient data storage, and retrieval mechanisms.

The system features a custom SQL parser, B+ tree indexing for optimized data access, and persistent file-based storage. It supports essential database operations including table creation, data insertion, complex querying with WHERE clauses, and batch processing capabilities. The project emphasizes the implementation of core computer science concepts in a real-world application context.

## âœ¨ Features

- **DDL Commands**: Create, drop, and manage database tables with custom field definitions
- **DML Commands**: Full support for SELECT, INSERT, CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE operations
- **Logical Operations in WHERE Clause**: Complex conditional filtering with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- **Relational Operations in WHERE Clause**: Support for =, >, <, >=, <=, != comparisons
- **B+ Tree Implementation**: Efficient data indexing and retrieval for optimal performance
- **Expression Evaluation**: Shunting Yard Algorithm and Reverse Polish Notation for query parsing
- **Custom Parser**: Hand-built SQL parser with state machine implementation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and reporting system
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface with prompt system
